## Feature Matrix Creation

### Overview
The feature matrix is a crucial component in enhancing the DRL recommender system. It is created using `categoryid` and `parentid` attributes of items to provide a richer representation of each item. This matrix is then used in the DRL model to improve recommendations, especially for items with limited interaction data (cold start items).

### Process of Feature Matrix Creation

1. **Data Collection**: The first step involves collecting `categoryid` and `parentid` for each item in the dataset. These attributes offer categorical information about the items, which is valuable for distinguishing between them.

2. **One-Hot Encoding**: 
    - The `categoryid` and `parentid` attributes are transformed using one-hot encoding. This process converts categorical data into a binary vector representation, which is more suitable for use in machine learning models.
    - Each unique category and parent ID is represented as a separate column, and each item is represented as a row in the resulting matrix.
    - If an item belongs to a particular category or has a specific parent ID, the corresponding column is marked with a 1; otherwise, it is marked with a 0.

3. **Feature Matrix Assembly**:
    - The one-hot encoded vectors for `categoryid` and `parentid` are combined to form a comprehensive feature matrix.
    - This matrix serves as a detailed representation of items, encapsulating their categorical relationships.

### Utilization in DRL Recommender System

- The feature matrix is integrated into the DRL recommender system as an additional input. It is used to inform the model about the characteristics of each item beyond just their interaction history.
- By incorporating this matrix, the recommender system can make more informed decisions, especially when recommending new or less interacted items.
- The feature matrix plays a pivotal role in addressing the cold start problem, as it provides the model with essential information about items that lack sufficient interaction data.

### Impact on Model Performance

- The integration of the feature matrix is expected to enhance the model's ability to discern between items and improve recommendation accuracy.
- It particularly aids in effectively recommending new items or items with sparse interaction data, thereby mitigating the cold start problem.
