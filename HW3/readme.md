To create a markdown for your GitHub repository that explains the modifications you've made to the DRL recommender system and the reasoning behind them, it's important to be clear and concise. The markdown should explain each change, its purpose, and reference any theoretical or empirical backing for the change if applicable.

Here's a draft of the markdown content that you can use or modify as needed for your GitHub repository:

## Modifications to the DRL Recommender System

### Overview
The Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) recommender system has been modified to incorporate item features for addressing the cold start problem. These modifications aim to enhance the model's ability to recommend items even when limited interaction data is available.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Feature Placeholder
A new placeholder for item features was introduced:

```python
self.feature_vector = feature_vector
```
**Purpose:** This placeholder allows the network to take additional item features as input, which is crucial for generating recommendations for new items (cold start items) that lack sufficient interaction history.

#### 2. Update Scoring Mechanism
The scoring mechanism was updated to integrate item features into the final score calculation:

```python
self.w_f = tf.compat.v1.layers.dense(
    self.feature_vector,
    self.hidden_size,
    use_bias=True,
    activation=None,
)
self.phi_2 = tf.matmul(
    self.states_hidden, self.w_f, transpose_b=True
)
self.final_score = (
    1 - self.lambda_score
) * self.output2 + self.lambda_score * self.phi_2
```
**Purpose:** By blending the original scores (`self.output2`) with the scores derived from item features (`self.phi_2`), the model can leverage additional information about items, enhancing its recommendation capabilities, especially for new items.

#### 3. Cross-Entropy Loss Update
The cross-entropy loss was modified to use the updated final scores:

```python
ce_loss = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
    labels=self.actions, logits=self.final_score
)
```
**Purpose:** This change ensures that the loss computation aligns with the updated scoring mechanism, allowing the model to learn effectively from the enhanced item representations.

#### 4. Prediction in Evaluation Function
The evaluation function was updated to use the new final scores for predictions:

```python
prediction = sess.run(QN_1.final_score, ...)
```
**Purpose:** To evaluate the model's performance with the new scoring mechanism, ensuring that the item features are utilized during the prediction phase.

#### 5. Feature Matrix in Network Initialization
The network initialization was modified to include the feature matrix:

```python
QN_1 = QNetwork(
    ...
    feature_vector=feature_matrix,
)
QN_2 = QNetwork(
    ...
    feature_vector=feature_matrix,
)
```
**Purpose:** This ensures that the item feature matrix is appropriately passed to the model during initialization, allowing the model to utilize these features right from the start of the training.

### References and Theoretical Background
The modifications are based on principles and findings from [Reference XX], which highlights the importance of integrating item features into recommendation systems to tackle the cold start problem.
