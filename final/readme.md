# Movie Recommendation System Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology and results of evaluating a movie recommendation system powered by GPT-3.5 using prompt engineering. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of the language model in generating movie recommendations compared to a baseline model.

## Prompt Engineering Method
- **Approach**: The prompt engineering method involves creating structured prompts to guide GPT-3.5 in generating movie recommendations. 
- **Implementation**: The prompts are designed to provide context (such as a list of previously watched movies and a candidate set of movies) and ask the language model to recommend movies based on this context.
- **Prompt Design**: Specific prompt structures are used to maximize the relevance and accuracy of the recommendations from GPT-3.5.

## Evaluation of LLM for Recommendation
- **Metric**: The effectiveness of the language model is measured using a 'hit rate', which is the ratio of correct recommendations to total recommendations.
- **Results**: The final hit rate for the GPT-3.5 based system is 0.4764705882352941. This indicates that nearly 47.65% of the recommendations made by the language model matched the user's actual next movie choice.

## Baseline Model
- **Model Description**: The baseline model is a simple 'most popular' movie recommender. It recommends the top N most popular movies based on the frequency of views in the dataset.
- **Evaluation Metric**: The baseline model is also evaluated using the hit rate metric, similar to the LLM-based system.

## Accuracy Measurement
- **For LLM-Based System**: The hit rate is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made.
- **For Baseline Model**: A similar approach is used, where the hit rate reflects the proportion of correct recommendations out of all recommendations made.

## Rigorousness of the Experiments
- **Data Consistency**: Both the LLM-based system and the baseline model are tested on the same set of user data for consistency.
- **Fair Comparison**: The same metric (hit rate) is used for evaluating both systems to ensure a fair and direct comparison of their performance.

## Conclusion
The GPT-3.5 based recommendation system significantly outperforms the baseline 'most popular' model, demonstrating the potential of advanced language models in personalized recommendation systems.
